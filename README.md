# 👾 Vikas — Future Pro Hacker (Ethical) & Security Engineer

I’m building myself into a **full-stack cybersecurity engineer**:

- 🛡 Defensive Security (Blue Team, SOC, DFIR)  
- 🧠 Detection Engineering & Threat Modeling  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping  
- 🤖 AI-driven automation & tooling (Python & Linux)

Right now, I’m focused on **building real tools**, not just tutorials.

## 🧨 Security / Hacking Labs (LEGAL)

### 🛡 SENTINEL-XDR — SOC Detection & Log Forensics  
**Repo:** [`sentinel-xdr`](https://github.com/vikas7070/sentinel-xdr)

A mini **XDR / SIEM-style platform**:

- Ingests auth logs (SSH, sudo)
- Normalizes raw logs → security events
- Detects 15 mapped threat types (brute force, takeover, priv-esc, malware-like behavior, etc.)
- Correlates alerts into **incidents**
- Scores incident severity
- Generates **analyst-grade reports & response recommendations**

> Built to simulate how a real SOC / DFIR team works.

### 🌐 NEXUS-AUDITOR — Network Recon & Exposure Mapping  
**Repo:** [`nexus-auditor`](https://github.com/vikas7070/nexus-auditor)

A **defensive recon tool** that:

- Scans hosts for open TCP ports (safe connect scans)
- Grabs lightweight banners (where safe)
- Guesses services (SSH, HTTP, DB, RDP, etc.)
- Assigns **risk levels** using a security-focused port catalog
- Builds an asset exposure report (text + JSON)

> Helps understand “what is exposed” before attackers do.

## 🧠 What I Actually Practice

- Log forensics & incident reconstruction  
- Brute-force & account-takeover detection logic  
- Network reconnaissance design (safe, legal)  
- Threat modeling and attack-chain thinking  
- Python tooling for security workflows  
- Linux + terminal-based workflows (Termux / server)

---

## 🛠 Tech & Security Stack

- 🐍 **Python** (scripting, tooling, automation)  
- 🐧 **Linux** / Termux  
- 🌐 Basic networking: TCP/IP, ports, SSH, HTTP  
- 🔐 Security concepts: brute force, takeover, priv-esc, recon, exposure  
- 🧩 Git & GitHub for real-world project structure  

---

## 📌 What I’m Looking For

- Intern / trainee roles in:  
  - SOC / Blue Team  
  - Cybersecurity engineering  
  - Security automation  
  - Python-based tooling

- Mentorship from people working in **security ops, detection, or DFIR**.
